## 🚀 **How to Test:**

### Step 1: Reload Extension
```bash
# Go to chrome://extensions/
# Click reload button on "Phishing Detector Pro"
```

### Step 2: Test Trust Scores
Visit these sites and check the popup results:

**✅ Trusted Sites:**
- `https://google.com` → Should show 5% risk, "Domain Reputation: EXCELLENT"
- `https://github.com` → Should show 5% risk, trust scores
- `https://amazon.com` → Should show 5% risk, verified safe

**⚠️ Suspicious Sites:**
- `http://fake-google-login.com` → Should show high risk, brand impersonation
- `http://suspicious-bank-update.com` → Should show high risk, multiple factors

### Step 3: Check Trust Score Details
1. Click extension icon on any site
2. Look for **trust score information** in the popup:
   - 🔍 "Trust sources checked: Domain Reputation"
   - ✅ "Domain Reputation: EXCELLENT (95%)" for trusted sites
   - ℹ️ "No trust score services available" if no API keys configured

### Step 4: Test Settings Page
1. Click gear icon in popup → Should open settings
2. Navigate between tabs → Should work without errors
3. Try saving settings → Should see success notification

## 🎯 **New Trust Score Features:**

### **Priority System:**
1. **🥇 Trust Scores** (checked first, highest priority)
   - Google Safe Browsing
   - VirusTotal  
   - Domain Reputation
2. **🥈 AI Models** (heuristic analysis)

### **Smart Override Logic:**
- **Trusted domains**: Automatically low risk regardless of other factors
- **Flagged by trust services**: Automatically high risk
- **Clean trust scores**: Lower risk even if AI detects issues
- **No trust data**: Falls back to AI model analysis

### **Visual Indicators:**
- ✅ Green checkmarks for verified safe
- ⚠️ Warning symbols for flagged content
- 🔍 Shows which trust sources were checked
- ℹ️ Info about missing API keys
