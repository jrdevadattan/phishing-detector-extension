## 🚀 How to Load the Extension in Chrome:

### Step 1: Open Chrome Extensions Page
1. Open Google Chrome
2. Navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" toggle in the top-right corner

### Step 2: Load the Extension
1. Click "Load unpacked" button
2. Navigate to and select the `phishing-detector-extension` directory
3. Click "Select" or "Open"

### Step 3: Verify Installation
You should see:
- ✅ "Phishing Detector Pro" appears in your extensions list
- ✅ Extension icon appears in Chrome toolbar
- ✅ No error messages in the extensions page

## 🧪 Testing the Extension:

### Basic Functionality Test:
1. **Click the extension icon** - should open popup
2. **Visit any website** - badge should update with risk level
3. **Click settings gear** - should open options page
4. **Try different websites** - should see different risk assessments

### Test with Different URL Types:
- **Safe sites**: `https://google.com` → Should show green "SAFE"
- **Suspicious patterns**: URLs with many suspicious words
- **IP addresses**: `http://192.168.1.1` → Should show higher risk

## ⚙️ Current Features Working:

### ✅ **Core Functionality:**
- Real-time URL analysis using heuristic detection
- Risk assessment (0-100%) with color-coded badges
- Popup interface showing detailed results
- Settings page with full configuration options
- Caching for performance optimization

### ✅ **Detection Features:**
- URL length analysis
- Suspicious word detection
- IP address vs domain detection
- URL shortener detection
- HTTPS/security analysis
- Domain structure analysis

### ✅ **User Interface:**
- Clean, professional popup design
- Comprehensive settings page with tabs
- Risk visualization with color coding
- Detailed analysis breakdown
- Warning notifications
- Auto-blocking capability (configurable)

## 🔧 Next Steps for Full Functionality:

### To Add Real AI Models:
1. **Download/train models** from the mentioned datasets
2. **Convert to TensorFlow.js format**:
   ```bash
   tensorflowjs_converter --input_format=keras model.h5 models/model_name/
   ```
3. **Replace simplified background script** with full AI version
4. **Enable ES6 modules** in manifest once TensorFlow.js is properly loaded

### To Add External APIs:
1. **Get API keys** from Google Safe Browsing and VirusTotal
2. **Enter keys** in the extension settings
3. **Enable trust score services** in configuration

## 🚨 Important Notes:

### Current Implementation:
- **Heuristic-based detection**: Uses rule-based analysis (not ML models yet)
- **Local processing**: All analysis runs in the browser
- **No external API calls**: Currently works offline
- **Fully functional**: Provides real phishing detection capabilities

### For Production Use:
- Add real AI models for better accuracy
- Configure external API keys for enhanced detection
- Test thoroughly with various websites
- Consider publishing to Chrome Web Store

## 🐛 If You Encounter Issues:

### Extension Won't Load:
